# 📖 Class 01 - PHP Introduction  

## 🌍 What is Web?  
The **web** (World Wide Web) is a collection of websites stored on the **internet**. Websites are built using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Backend Languages (like PHP)**.  

💡 **Example:**  
When you visit `www.google.com`, your browser loads files from Google's server.

## 🖥️ What is a Server?  
A **server** is a computer that stores websites and delivers them to users. When you type a URL, your browser requests the website from a server.  

💡 **Example:**  
When you visit `www.facebook.com`, the request goes to **Facebook's server**, which responds with the webpage files.

## 🌐 What is Domain & Hosting?  
- **Domain**: The name of a website (e.g., `google.com`)  
- **Hosting**: The server where the website files are stored  

💡 **Example:**  
Imagine a website is a **house**:  
🏠 **Domain** = House Address  
💾 **Hosting** = Storage where files are kept

## 🔄 How a Website Works?  
1️⃣ You type `www.example.com` in a browser  
2️⃣ The request goes to a **DNS Server**  
3️⃣ The **server** finds and sends website files  
4️⃣ The browser **displays** the website
