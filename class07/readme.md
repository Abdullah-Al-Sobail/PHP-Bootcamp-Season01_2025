# **CRUD Application with PHP, MySQL, and Bootstrap**

This project demonstrates how to create a fully featured CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using PHP, MySQL, and Bootstrap. The application allows users to create, edit, view, and delete posts in a simple blog-like system. The application includes user input validation, session handling, and structured file management to demonstrate real-world PHP development practices.

---

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Clone the project into your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Create Database**:
   Create a MySQL database and table for the application:

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE crud_project;
   ```

   Then, create a `posts` table:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE posts (
       id INT(11) AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
       email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
       des TEXT NOT NULL
   );
   ```

3. **Configure Database Connection**:
   Edit the `env.php` file and set the correct database connection details:

   ```php
   $db_hostname = 'localhost';
   $db_username = 'root';  // Your MySQL username
   $db_password = '';      // Your MySQL password
   $db_name = 'crud_project';
   ```

4. **Run the Project**:
   Place the project files in your web server's root directory (e.g., `htdocs` for XAMPP). Start the server and navigate to `http://localhost/index.php` to begin using the CRUD application.
